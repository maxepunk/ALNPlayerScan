# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ALN Memory Scanner is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for the "About Last Night" immersive game. Players scan QR codes/RFID tokens to reveal memory content (images, audio, video). The app supports two deployment modes:

1. **Standalone Mode** (GitHub Pages): No backend, purely client-side, local-only operation
2. **Networked Mode** (Orchestrator Integration): Connected to backend orchestrator for video playback and synchronized state

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### Dual-Mode Operation
The scanner detects its deployment context automatically:
- **Standalone**: Served from GitHub Pages (any path except `/player-scanner/`)
- **Networked**: Served from orchestrator at `/player-scanner/` path

Detection in `js/orchestratorIntegration.js:17`:
```javascript
this.isStandalone = !window.location.pathname.startsWith('/player-scanner/');
```

**Implications:**
- Standalone mode NEVER attempts orchestrator connection (no monitoring, no queue)
- Networked mode enables connection monitoring and offline queue management
- Mode cannot be manually configured - purely path-based detection

### Token Data Synchronization Architecture

**Shared Database via Git Submodule:**
```
aln-memory-scanner/
├── data/                    # Git submodule → ALN-TokenData repo
│   └── tokens.json          # Shared with Player Scanner and GM Scanner
└── tokens.json.backup       # Fallback (deprecated)
```

**Key Principle**: Single source of truth via Git submodules. Both Player Scanner and GM Scanner repos point to the same ALN-TokenData repository.

**Fallback Chain** (`index.html:~800`):
1. `data/tokens.json` (submodule - preferred)
2. `tokens.json` (root - backward compatibility)
3. Demo data (hardcoded fallback)

### Token Structure
Each token contains both player-facing and GM-facing fields:
```json
{
  "token_id": {
    "image": "assets/images/file.jpg",    // Player scanner displays
    "audio": "assets/audio/file.mp3",     // Player scanner plays
    "video": "filename.mp4",              // Triggers orchestrator playback
    "SF_RFID": "token_id",                // GM scanner logic
    "SF_ValueRating": 1-5,                // GM scanner scoring
    "SF_MemoryType": "Type",              // GM scanner categorization
    "SF_Group": "Group (xN)"              // GM scanner set tracking
  }
}
```

**Path Resolution:**
- Images/Audio: Relative paths from scanner app (`assets/images/`, `assets/audio/`)
- Videos: Filename only (orchestrator resolves to `backend/public/videos/`)

## Development Workflow

### Primary Command: sync.py
The `sync.py` script is the central tool for ALL token and deployment operations:

```bash
python3 sync.py              # Sync tokens + regenerate QR codes locally
python3 sync.py --deploy     # Sync + regenerate + deploy to GitHub Pages
python3 sync.py --local      # Sync locally (no GitHub operations)
```

**What sync.py does:**
1. Enters `data/` submodule directory
2. Commits local token changes (if any) to ALN-TokenData repo
3. Pushes to shared repository
4. Pulls latest changes from other contributors
5. Returns to parent repo
6. Regenerates QR codes (adds new, removes old, updates changed)
7. (With `--deploy`) Commits and pushes to GitHub Pages

**Critical**: Always run `sync.py --deploy` after editing tokens anywhere (GM scanner, Player scanner, or ALN-TokenData directly).

### Token Editing Workflow

**Option 1: Edit in submodule**
```bash
cd data
git checkout main
# Edit tokens.json
git add tokens.json
git commit -m "Update tokens"
git push origin main
cd ..
python3 sync.py --deploy  # Sync QR codes and deploy
```

**Option 2: Use sync.py (recommended)**
```bash
# Edit data/tokens.json directly
python3 sync.py --deploy  # Handles all git operations automatically
```

**Option 3: GitHub Actions (no CLI needed)**
- Navigate to Actions tab
- Run "Sync & Deploy" workflow
- Waits ~2 minutes for completion

### QR Code Management
QR codes are auto-generated by `sync.py`:
- Uses Python `qrcode` library (install: `pip install qrcode[pil]`)
- Stored in `qr-codes/` directory
- Automatically adds new tokens, removes deleted tokens, updates existing
- QR data is the raw token ID (matches keys in `tokens.json`)

**Manual generation:**
```bash
python3 generate-qr.py  # Interactive with style options (basic/labeled/colored)
```

## Testing and Development

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open browser
open http://localhost:8000

# Test QR scanning with generated codes from qr-codes/
```

**PWA Testing:**
- Install via browser's "Add to Home Screen"
- Test offline functionality (disconnect network after first load)
- Verify service worker in DevTools > Application > Service Workers
- Force cache update by incrementing `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js:4`

### Service Worker Updates
When modifying cached files (index.html, config.html, orchestratorIntegration.js):
1. Update `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js:4` (e.g., `'aln-scanner-v1.2'`)
2. Deploy changes
3. Users must close all app tabs and reopen to activate new service worker

## Key Components

### index.html
Single-page application with embedded JavaScript (~1000 lines):
- `MemoryScanner` class: Main application logic
- Token loading with fallback chain
- QR scanner integration (html5-qrcode library via CDN)
- Audio/image display logic
- Collection management (localStorage)
- Orchestrator integration via `OrchestratorIntegration` class

### js/orchestratorIntegration.js
Manages backend communication in networked mode:
- Auto-detects standalone vs networked deployment
- Connection monitoring with exponential backoff
- Offline queue management (max 100 transactions)
- Automatic retry on reconnection
- LocalStorage persistence for offline scans

### config.html
Network configuration UI for networked mode:
- Manual orchestrator URL override
- Connection status indicator
- Device ID management

### sw.js
Service worker for offline PWA functionality:
- App shell caching strategy
- External resource caching (QR scanner library)
- Network-first for token data
- Cache-first for assets

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Standalone Mode)
1. Push to main branch
2. GitHub Pages serves from root directory
3. Access at: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/`
4. Deployment takes ~1-2 minutes
5. PWA service worker may cache for up to 5 minutes (force refresh to bypass)

**Auto-deployment:**
- Any push to main triggers deployment
- Manual workflow trigger via Actions tab
- `sync.py --deploy` handles the entire flow

### Orchestrator Integration (Networked Mode)
When served from orchestrator's `/player-scanner/` endpoint:
- Backend serves static files from this repo (copied to `backend/public/player-scanner/`)
- Path-based detection enables connection monitoring
- Video playback triggers orchestrator's video queue
- Offline scans queued and synced when connection restored

## Common Tasks

### Add New Token
1. Edit `data/tokens.json`
2. Add image/audio files to `assets/images/` or `assets/audio/`
3. Run `python3 sync.py --deploy`
4. Print QR code from `qr-codes/[token_id].png`

### Update Existing Token Content
1. Edit token fields in `data/tokens.json`
2. Replace asset files if needed
3. Run `python3 sync.py --deploy`
4. QR codes remain the same (token ID unchanged)

### Remove Token
1. Delete token entry from `data/tokens.json`
2. Run `python3 sync.py --deploy` (automatically removes QR code)
3. Clean up asset files manually if desired

### Sync Multiple Editors' Changes
```bash
python3 sync.py --deploy
# Git automatically merges changes from other contributors
# Conflicts require manual resolution in data/tokens.json
```

### Test Orchestrator Integration Locally
1. Start orchestrator backend (see parent repo)
2. Ensure backend serves this scanner at `/player-scanner/`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/player-scanner/`
4. Networked mode auto-activates

## Important Notes

- **No Build Process**: Pure HTML/JS/CSS, no compilation
- **External Dependencies**: QR Scanner library loaded from CDN (unpkg.com)
- **Asset Paths**: All paths relative to support GitHub Pages subdirectory hosting
- **Submodule Updates**: Require update in both Player Scanner and GM Scanner repos
- **Offline Collection**: Stored in localStorage, persists across sessions
- **Token IDs**: Must match between `tokens.json` keys and QR code data
- **Video Support**: Videos play via orchestrator only (not in standalone mode)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Changes not showing on GitHub Pages | Wait 2 minutes, check Actions tab, force refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) |
| Can't push to GitHub | Check branch (`git branch`), pull first (`git pull`), retry |
| Submodule out of sync | `git submodule update --force`, then `python3 sync.py` |
| QR codes missing | Run `python3 sync.py` to regenerate |
| Service worker caching old version | Update `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js`, redeploy, close all tabs |
| Orchestrator not connecting | Check path (must be `/player-scanner/`), verify backend running |
| Offline queue not syncing | Check localStorage quota, verify connection restored |
